Pokémon, created by Satoshi Tajiri, is a series that debuted in 1996 with Pokémon Blue, Red and Green. Pokemon is an adventure JRPG centered around the player collecting monsters and battling them against friends and enemies.

Released to overwhelming success, Pokémon spawned a world known series that has seen numerous movies, multiple TV anime series, manga, and a series of JRPGS. Between the 1990s and the 2000s, Nintendo released a total of 9 main series games and 3 spin off titles from 1996 until 2002.

Pokémon as a franchise has grown so large that it is no longer considered to be just a video game franchise but a media franchise. Pokémon is now one of the most well known media franchises in the world. It is the highest-grossing entertainment media franchise of all time, making more than $75 billion revenue as of May 2016 (The Pokémon Company, 2016).

Pokémon is such a large franchise in Japan that for certain events, The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have teamed up with Japanese railway companies to theme their trains as certain Pokémon. For example, the [Meitetsu 2200 series](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E5%90%8D%E9%89%842201F%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A9%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%83%9F%E5%8F%B720080720.jpg#/media/File:%E5%90%8D%E9%89%842201F%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A9%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%83%9F%E5%8F%B720080720.jpg) was themed as Giratina and the [Shinkansen E3 Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon#/media/File:E311-1000.JPG) was emblazoned with Pikachu and other popular Pokémon.

Recently, Nintendo released Pokémon GO, an augmented reality mobile game where people all around the world participate in catching Pokémon in real world locations.

Due to Pokémon's success, Nintendo has opened multiple Pokémon stores in Japan (11) and in the United States (3), most notable being the Pokémon Mega Center Tokyo store and the Nintendo New York Pokémon Centre.
