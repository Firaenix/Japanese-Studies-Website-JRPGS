The next major revolution came in the mid-to-late 1990s, which saw the rise of 3D computer graphics and optical discs in fifth generation consoles.

3D computer graphics also allowed more realistic physics engines, which were shown in video games such as Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64. During the late 90s, the use of portable systems such as the Gameboy and Gameboy Color were becoming more and more popular in the mainstream market, introducing more people to the video game industry.

The implications of 3D graphics and optical discs for JRPGs were enormous; longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

The use of cutscenes and full motion video in Final Fantasy VII set a trend for the Final Fantasy series that the franchise is now known for.

Later in the 1990s, there was a rise in JRPGS where the player collected monsters, the most well known of these was Pokémon. Pokémon released in 1996 to an unprecedented success in the Japanese Video Game market, impacting and influencing a whole generation of children and is now one of the most well known and influential franchises of all time.
