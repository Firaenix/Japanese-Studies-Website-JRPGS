Final Fantasy VII (1997), with its use of 3D graphics and CD-ROM discs, was an important milestone that popularized the genre worldwide.

With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million,[250] the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore,[252] much longer quest, more numerous sidequests,[250] dozens of minigames, and much higher production values.

Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high playability, lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline,[253] and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs.
