Final Fantasy VII (1997), with its use of 3D graphics and CD-ROM discs, was an important milestone that popularized the genre worldwide.

The rise of 3D computer graphics had major implications for RPGs. RPGs could now have longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million,[250] the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore,[252] much longer quest, more numerous sidequests,[250] dozens of minigames, and much higher production values.

The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds,[253] battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay,[251] effectively integrated throughout the game.[250] Gameplay innovations included the materia system, which allowed a considerable amount of customization and flexibility through materia that can be combined in many different ways and exchanged between characters at any time, and the limit breaks, special attacks that can be performed after a character's limit meter fills up by taking hits from opponents.[251] The materia system is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the slotted item system in Diablo II (2000).[254] Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high playability, lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline,[253] and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs.[255] The game's storytelling and character development was considered a major narrative jump forward for video games and was often compared to films and novels at the time.[256]
