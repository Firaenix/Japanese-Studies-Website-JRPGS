Final Fantasy VII (1997), with its use of 3D graphics and CD-ROM discs, was an important milestone that popularized the genre worldwide. After Final Fantasy VII, the subsequent entries in the series continued to use full motion video cutscenes, with each entry being given a larger budget for development.

Final Fantasy VII had a production budget of $45 million (1up, 2011), an unprecedented amount of money to spend on a video game at the time. Along with the large production budget came an expansive world, a 40 hour long quest, a large array of sidequests and minigames and high quality graphics.

One of the technical innovations introduced by the game was the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, allowing very detailed levels and set pieces. Final Fantasy VII was also one of the first games that used full motion video to seamlessly blend into the gameplay (1up, 2011), which is now a commonly used technique in modern day JRPGs and Western RPGs alike.

The games narrative was much darker and more intricate than other RPGs at the time and was highly praised for the high replayability and well developed characters. It was considered to be a major improvement over the previous RPG narratives and reviewers often compared the narrative with films and novels (Boyer, Cifaldi, 2006).

Final Fantasy VII has solidified its role as one of the best and most influential games of all time, setting a precedent for almost all modern JRPGs, selling well over 18 million copies world wide, grossing over $1.697 billion world wide (VGSales, 2017).
