Japanese video game companies, in the mid to late 2000s were criticized for long development times, slow release cycles and being much to insular to appeal to global markets. Many critics state that the Japanese video game industry have been stuck trying to relive their 'golden era' of the 1990s and innovation in the field has stagnated (Ashcraft, 2011). In 2002, the Japanese video game industry held 50% of the world video game market, however, by 2010, this percentage had shrunk to 10% (Cieslak, 2010).

In recent years however, critics are finding that Japan is slowly making pace back to the forefront of the video game industry, leading many to wonder if the industry is going through a 'renaissance' period (Lennon, 2017). While criticised as being very similar to previous titles without innovating on the genre, the JRPG genre has recently been considered to be revitalised by games such as Xenoblade Chronicles and the Persona Series. Some critics have considered 2017 to be the year that "Japanese RPGs Caught up to Western RPGs" (Leack, 2017).

Newer Japanese video games have been seeing wider adoption of Western style video game elements, relying more heavily on immersing the player in the video game rather than masses of text and dialogue to scroll through. Japanese RPGs were once critised as being too 'mechanical' and text heavy, but are embracing more modern standards, while innovating on the new direction the market has taken.
