### In recent years, Japanese companies have been criticized for long development times and slow release dates on home video game consoles, their lack of third-party game engines, and for being too insular to appeal to a global market. Along with this, the Japanese video game industry has been criticised as being stuck in the 1990s, the time period that was considered to be their "golden era". (Ashcraft, 2011)
