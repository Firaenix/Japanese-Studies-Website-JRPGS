When Chrono Trigger launched in 1995, it quickly became one of the best considered video game RPGs of all time, not limited to only JRPGs. Introducing concepts such as the "Active Time Battle" system and hundreds of combo attacks that characters can perform with eachother, it quickly became the gold standard for JRPGs in the future.

Some of the appeals of Chrono Trigger stems from its non linear gameplay, allowing players to explore detailed worlds at their own pace, over a dozen different endings, the branching plot, and introducing no random enemy encounters.

SquareSoft put 5 people in charge of the development of Chrono Trigger:
* _Akira Toriyama_ ; Manga Artist and creator of the popular Dragonball series and artist behind the Dragon Warrior series.
* _Nobuo Uematsu_ ; sometimes referred to as the "Beethoven of video games music" (Classic FM, 2013).
* _Yuuji Horii_ ; Creator of the Dragon Quest series.
* _Kazuhiko Aoki_ ; Battle designer for the Final Fantasy Series.
* _Hironobu Sakaguchi_ ; Game designer, game director, game producer for the Final Fantasy Series.

The title was recieved to critical acclaim and sold over 2,030,000 copies in Japan alone, cementing this title as one of the best JRPGs of all time.
Chrono Trigger and its impact on the JRPG genre was one of the main factors that the 1990s were considered the Golden Era of video gaming history.
