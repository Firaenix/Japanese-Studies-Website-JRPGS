The second in the Mana series, further advanced the action RPG subgenre with its introduction of cooperative multiplayer into the genre.

The game was created by a team previously responsible for the first three Final Fantasy titles: Nasir Gebelli, Koichi Ishii, and Hiromichi Tanaka.

It was intended to be one of the first CD-ROM RPGs, as a launch title for the SNES CD add-on, but had to be altered to fit onto a standard game cartridge after the SNES CD project was dropped.[212]

The game received considerable acclaim,[213] for its innovative pausable real-time battle system,[214][215] the "Ring Command" menu system,[215] its innovative cooperative multiplayer gameplay,[213] where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time rather than players having to join the game at the same time,[216] and the customizable AI settings for computer-controlled allies.[217]

The game has influenced a number of later action RPGs.
