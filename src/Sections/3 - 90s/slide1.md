The second entry in the Mana series, further advanced the action RPG subgenre with its introduction of cooperative multiplayer.

The game was created by a team previously responsible for the first three Final Fantasy titles: Nasir Gebelli, Koichi Ishii, and Hiromichi Tanaka.

Secret of Mana recieved acclaim for its bright graphics, interesting plot, the innovative real-time battle system - allowing players to actively participate in battles by moving around the world instead of waiting in menus, and its cooperative multiplayer gameplay - the second or third players were given the ability to join or leave the game whenever they wished, alternatively, the game allowed for human players to be replaced by customisible AI for computer allies.
