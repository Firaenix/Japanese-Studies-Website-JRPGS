The 1990s and 2000s are often referred to as the 'golden age' of console Japanese Role Playing Games. Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters with detailed and relatable backstories.

A standard trope that was introduced into the JRPG genre was the Job System, which was a character progression system that allowed players to change character classes and customise their characters as they levelled up. This allowed for every player to have their own way of playing, making JRPGs much more replayable. Another trope that was added in the 90s was the Tactics system, allowing the player to affect the flow of battles by switching characters between attacking and defending.

Another interesting feature that was introduced in this Golden Age of Video Games was the multiplayer mode. Introducing the cooperative multiplayer mode into the RPG genre was Seiken Dendetsu 2 (Also known as Secret of Mana in North America and Europe).

Chrono Trigger, released in 1995, put a new battle system called the "Active Time Battle" (ATB) to use by having time progress naturally in battle, filling a character's "ATB metre", once this metre is full, the character is allowed to choose an attack. This introduced a sense of urgency and excitement and was considered revolutionary for the time as it introduced a mix between turn based and real time RPG combat.
