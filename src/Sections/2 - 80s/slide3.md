## In Japan, the Dragon Warrior brand is synonomous with Role Playing Games and as of 2016 has 11 games in the core series along with a multitude of spin off titles.

## Dragon Warrior is a cultural sensation in Japan, with young, old and famous people (CITATION NEEDED) enamoured with the game.

## Keiko Awaji, a Japanese Actress, famous for her movies such as Stray Dog (1949) and The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), has previously confessed her love for the series;

## _"I won't live forever," said Awaji. "I'd like to play two or more games... I really want them to put out a new game once every two years." (Ashcraft, 2009)._

I am unsure what you want on this page besides famous people quoting the games. I was thinking video games hitting the mainstream would fit more in the modern era with E3 being a huge success and a lot of people making their jobs game-related like Youtubers and websites like Vooks. I cant save anymore, I dont know why. I get errors.
