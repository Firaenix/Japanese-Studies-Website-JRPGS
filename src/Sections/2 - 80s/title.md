# Time to rewrite The Golden Age of Arcade video games

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_gaming_in_Japan)

* _People have been playing games for centuries, such as sports games or games like chess. The video game industry began rising in the early 1970s. Prior to producing video games, Japanese companies like Sega, Taito, Namco and Nintendo were producers of electro-mechanical arcade games. In the 1970s many of these companies turned their attention to producing arcade video games. Japan eventually became a major exporter of video games during the golden age of arcade video games, an era that began with the release of Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and ended around the mid-1980s._

* _In 1982 many new video games flooded the North American market and stores did not have the capacity to sell them. A lot of games were awful and sold at discouunts, ruining the video game market and by June 1983 the market for the more expensive, better games had shrunk and had been replaced by low-budget games. The video game market economy crashed and many producers abandoned their posts. Atari even buried hundreds of thousands of game cartridges. North America's video game industry had crashed. This gave Japan the opportunity to become the most dominant country within the global video game industry. The NA video game crash of 1983, and the shift of dominance of home video games from the US to Japan, sparked the transition from block-based graphics to smooth hardware scrolling tile and sprite based graphics. It was a pivotal leap in game design (ref.). This generation of games was called the third generation of video games, also known as the 8-bit era. The main consoles of this era were the NES/Famicom and the SEGA III Master System._

* _One of the earliest Japanese RPGs, Koei's The Dragon and Princess (1982),[38] featured a tactical turn-based combat system. The milestone titles of the 1980s in Japan were Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Castlevania and Metroid, Metal Gear, and Super Mario Bros (all NES) and Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Phantasy Star (for the Sega Master System). Phantasy Star was among the first to use a science fiction setting and to feature a female protagonist. Many of these games were the first of what are now phenomenal video games series such as Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda._

* _In the 1980s, Japanese developers produced a diverse array of creative, experimental computer RPGs, like a Cambrian explosion, prior to mainstream titles such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy eventually cementing genre tropes._

* _the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series remain popular today, Final Fantasy more so in the West and Dragon Quest more so in Japan._
