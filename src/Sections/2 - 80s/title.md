People have been playing games such as sports, card games and chess for centuries. People playing video games, however, is a relatively new phenomenon. The video game industry began rising in the early 1970s and it has had a major impact on the world ever since.

Prior to producing video games, Japanese companies like Sega, Taito, Namco and Nintendo were producers of electro-mechanical arcade games. In the 1970s many of these companies turned their attention from arcade machines to to producing arcade Video Games.
The milestone titles of the 1980s in Japan were Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Castlevania and Super Mario Bros. Many of these games were the first of what are now world renowned video games series such as Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda.

In the 1980s, Japanese developers produced a diverse array of creative, experimental computer RPGs prior to mainstream titles such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, eventually cementing genre tropes. Early Japanese RPGs were also influenced by visual novel adventure games, which were developed by companies such as Enix, Square, Nihon Falcom and Koei before they moved onto developing RPGs.

The Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series remain popular today, Final Fantasy more so in the West and Dragon Quest more so in Japan.
