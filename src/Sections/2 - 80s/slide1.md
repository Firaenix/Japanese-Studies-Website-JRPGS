Dragon Quest was one of the earliest examples of an open world game with non linear gameplay, meaning that players were free to explore the world of Dragon Quest at their own pace and choose which quests they wanted to do.

Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragonball and highly influential Japanese manga artist was responsible for the art in the series, bringing his unique art style to the franchise and was the artist behind the "Slime" monster which is now the mascot of the series.

Since Dragon Quest's release, it has become a cultural sensation in Japan, to the point that Dragon Quest is a common topic of conversation, much like popular TV programmes (Iwata Asks, 2010). The series has even become a large enough franchise in Japan that a "Dragon Quest Museum" was opened in Tokyo.

Dragon Quest was one of the first major powerhouses in Japanese video gaming, selling over 2 million copies on the Nintendo Famicom alone. There are 11 main-series titles and multiple spin-offs. Dragon Quest has had a major impact on Japanese culture: Nearly every game in the main series has either an anime or manga adaptation, or both. Furthermore, each Dragon Quest video game soundtrack is arranged into an orchestral piece and the video game series is the first to have live-action ballet adaptations (Chalk, 2008).

"_At the time I first made Dragon Quest, computer and video game RPGs were still very much in the realm of hardcore fans and not very accessible to other players. So I decided to create a system that was easy to understand and emotionally involving, and then placed my story within that framework. - Yuji Horii on the design of the first Dragon Quest._"
