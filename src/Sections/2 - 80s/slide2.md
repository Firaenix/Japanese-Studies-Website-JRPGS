* _Square's original Final Fantasy for the NES had a character creation system that allowed the player to create their own parties and assign different character classes to party members,[citation needed] who in turn evolve through an early class change system later in the game.[136][137] It also featured concepts such as time travel;[138] side-view battles, with the player characters on the right and the enemies on the left, which soon became the norm for numerous console RPGs;[139] and the use of transportation for travel, "by ship, canoe, and even flying airship. While creating Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi took inspiration from certain elements in Hayao Miyazaki's anime films, such as the airships being inspired by Castle in the Sky._

* Final Fantasy II, is considered "the first true Final Fantasy game", introducing an "emotional story line, morally ambiguous characters, tragic events," and a story to be "emotionally experienced rather than concluded from gameplay and conversations." It also replaced traditional levels and experience points with an activity-based progression system, where "the more you use a skill, the better you are with it,"[146] a mechanic that later appeared in SaGa,[147] Grandia,[148] Final Fantasy XIV,[149] and The Elder Scrolls.[146] Final Fantasy II also featured open-ended exploration,[146] and had a dialogue system where keywords or phrases can be memorized and mentioned during conversations with NPCs,[150] the theme of an evil empire against a small band of rebels (similar to Star Wars), and the iconic chocobo, a fictional creature inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.
