Final Fantasy, now one of the worlds most respected video game franchises, a series synonymous with video games in the West and Japan alike, began by setting genre tropes and cementing Squaresoft as one of the great creators in video games.

The original Final Fantasy was one of the first JRPGs to introduce a character creation system, allowing players to create their own parties, customise character classes, affecting the gameplay later as the party levels up.

Final Fantasy set the norm for JRPGs at the time with "side-view" battles, showing the players on the right side of the screen and enemies on the left.

The creator of Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi stated that he took inspriration from Hayao Miyazaki's films such as Castle in the sky for airships.

In 1987, Final Fantasy was released on the Nintendo Famicom in Japan to wild success, selling more than 1 million copies. Nowadays, it is one of the largest Eastern RPG franchises selling well over 130 million copies since December 18, 1987 (Square Enix, 2017).
