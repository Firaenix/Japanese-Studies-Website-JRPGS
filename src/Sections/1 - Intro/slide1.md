### Japanese Role Playing Games (JRPGs) are a subgenre of Role Playing Games, mainly focussing on Role Playing Video Games. JRPGs are developed in Japan and have their own distinct influences and cultural impacts to traditional RPGs. Many Japanese Role Playing Games are influenced by traditional table top role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons.

### Japan's first RPG was released in 1982 with Koei's Underground Exploration (Pepe, 16). However, it was not until around 1986 when Enix released Dragon Quest, did Japanese RPGS slowly start making their way into the mainstream audiences. By 2000, Japanese franchises such as Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and Pokemon became well known world wide and have attracted millions of people around the world.

### Some of these Japanese RPG franchises have become so popular, they have spawned TV Anime, Manga, World known stores, Orchestrated performances and even Ballet acts!
